If you spend more than 90 minutes a day on email, struggle to follow up consistently, or want every email you send to be sharper, MailPilot is built for you. It is especially valuable for sales teams, executives, consultants and anyone maintaining a large professional network.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does it learn my writing style?",
    a: "Through a one-time Persona setup. You describe your style or paste sample emails, and MailPilot captures your formality, greetings and sign-offs, sentence length, tone and recurring phrases. Every draft is written against that Persona.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the Inbox Performance Overview show?",
    a: "Sent and received volume, average response time, reply rate, unanswered emails and how long they have waited, your top contacts, relationship scores and activity trends, all in one view.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does relationship intelligence work?",
    a: "MailPilot builds a profile for every contact from your existing email: communication history, frequency, last interaction, pending follow-ups and notes. A relationship score based on recency, frequency and response rate flags contacts that are cooling, with no separate data entry.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are follow-ups handled?",
    a: "If a reply doesn't arrive within the window you set, MailPilot schedules a follow-up draft personalised from the original email and your Persona. You can approve each one or let them send automatically. Per-contact frequency limits keep it from ever feeling pushy.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much control do I keep?",
    a: "All of it. In Draft mode nothing sends without your approval. In Semi-automatic mode follow-ups send on their own while reply drafts still wait for you. You can add instructions per email or per contact, and pause automation for any contact or thread.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which email platforms are supported?",
    a: "Gmail (Google Workspace and personal) and Outlook (Office 365 and Outlook.com), with two-way sync. Emails always send from your own address. More platforms are on the roadmap. Book a demo to confirm support for your environment.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does it cost?",
    a: "MailPilot uses 200 credits per month through the SuperMIA Agent Marketplace. New accounts receive free starter credits, so you can start without a credit card. Team and volume pricing is available on request.",
